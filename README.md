This repository contains a modified version of the MaKey MaKeys firmware (version 1.4.2). It uses a key configuration stored in the EEPROM of the ATmega 32U4 - and a default configuration as fallback.

(In the original version the key codes are defined at compile time and the firmware needs to be re-built in order to modify the configuration.)

Hint: reduced number of usable inputs from 18 to 14 (due to hardware issues, probably revision inconsistencies).
