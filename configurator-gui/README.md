# Usage

```
python3 configurator-gui/configurator-gui.py
```

Select keys in the dropdown menus of the GUI, click the "Generate binary" button.

The selection can be limited by commenting out entries of `keyDict`. It can also be expanded by adding more entries, of course.

The output is stored in a file called "eeprom.bin" in the current working directory.
